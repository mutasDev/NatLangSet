# NatLangSet

This repository holds a set of natural language descriptions based on the methodology described in [this](https://project.mutas.dev) research project.

## Content
Each snippet is present twice in the data set.
The snippets are once present in the directory [data/experiments_dow](data/experiments_dow) where they are sorted by the vulnerability (CWE) they were originally constructed for. Each CWE folder contains one or more scenarios (use case) and each scenario folder contains, with exceptions, three files, where each represents one natural language descriptions of a program for that scenario.

Further, each snippet is present once more, sorted by the original programming language it was generated from, [C](data/c) and [Python](data/python) respectively.
